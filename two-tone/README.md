# Two Tone

To run this sonic code snippet:
- download the sample pack published at https://synth.is/pub/sound/01eb1sh43v5ks1e4j0aj9phfbk_13_11_FM-AM-filter-distortion_6000 and expand it into `~/samples` on your system
- *load* the `two_tone.rb` file in to [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) and hit the *run* button (or the `cmd-r` or `ctrl-r` key combinations)
- play around with e.g. the `kick_multi` variable, changing it to values like 0.25, 0,5, 1, 2 and 4, hitting *run* (`cmd-r`) in between
